You're developing a React application on top of the Hedera distributed ledger that integrates an [SDK to implement Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks#decentralized-identity-sdks) for user authentication and data verification.

**Part 1:**
How would you design a front-end component that allows users to create, manage, and verify their decentralised identity (DID) on Hedera? Outline your approach and key considerations.

**Part 2:**
What strategies would you use to securely store and retrieve user credentials while ensuring privacy, minimal centralisation, and compliance with standards like [DID Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#core-properties) and [Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)?
