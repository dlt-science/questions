### Longest Sub-string Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest sub-string without repeating characters.

For example:

- a string `s = "abcabcbb"` should return 3 ("abc" has a length of 3)

- a string `s = "pwwkew"` should return 3 ("wke" has a length of 3)

- a string `s = "a1b2c3d4"` should return 8 (all characters are unique)

- a string `s = "abcaefgh"` should return 6 (sub-string is at the end)

etc.
